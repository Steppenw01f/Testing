# Contributing to ars discendi

This page provides information about contributing code to the ars discendi project.

## Engaging in the Project

* If you are a new contributor, see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)

* Before opening a new pull request, create an issue describing the problem you want to solve or the code that should be enhanced. Please note if you are willing to work on that issue.

* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. 

* When creating an issue, try using one of our issue templates which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.

* The maintainer will review the issue and decide whether it should be implemented as a Pull Request. In that case and if you're willing to work on it, he will assign the issue to you. If the maintainer decides against picking up the issue, it will be closed with a proper explanation.

* Relevant coding style guidelines are available at https://google.github.io/styleguide/.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an existing issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you would like to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.

Only start working on the Pull Request after the maintainer assigned the issue to you to avoid unnecessary efforts.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.

The following rule governs code contributions:

* Contributions must be licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE)
